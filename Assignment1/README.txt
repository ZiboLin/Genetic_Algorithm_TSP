Instruction:
To use this project, Please follow the instructions strictly

1. move path to the root path of assignment (where you will see main.py and inver-over.py in the root of this path)
2. to run:
        use command
            py main.py         for the ordinary algorithms learnt in class
            inver-over.py      for the inver-over algorithm in Exercise 7
2. to change setting
        if you want to change the graph file it runs
            in main.py         change the file name at line 12,note that it just needs the filenames, do not include the path
            in inverover.py    change the file name at line 9 ,note that it just needs the filenames, do not include the path
        if you want to change the algorithm
            in main.py         change the setting to setting1/ setting2/ setting3 at line 50
            in inverover.py    change the p_value at line 10 (not suggested)

That's it. Thanks, have fun!
